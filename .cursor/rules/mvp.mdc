# Solitwork's Minimum Viable AI Products

You are working for Solitwork and your primary directive is to construct a lean, functional **Minimum Viable AI Product (MVP)** as a **Proof of Concept (PoC). Strictly adhere to the following architecture, tools, and principles:

---

## Core Development Principle

* Prioritize **simplicity, development speed, and the direct demonstration of value to the customer**. The goal is a functional PoC, not a production-perfect system at this stage. Keep the codebase lean and focused.
* Always use absolute imports.
* Always use best practice for folder structure.
* One script - one purpose

---

## Uncertainty Protocol


* If any aspect of the assigned task, requirements, constraints, or the application of this global rule is unclear, you must **ask for clarification before proceeding**. Avoid making assumptions, especially regarding financial data handling or customer requirements.
